Chances are, you belong to one of the two categories. You either know touch typing as just "typing", or, you just googled what it is. How is this relevant to Emacs? Well, Emacs learning curve becomes a lot steeper if you are not a touch typer. This is because Emacs, for the most part, uses CTRL (C- ) or META (M- , Option key in OSX, ALT in Windows) keys as prefixes for control sequences e.g. C-x, M-x. Don't get me wrong, it's still Emacs. So, you can literally customize any of these key bindings to your preference. If vi/vim is more your style, you can give Evil mode a shot. Either way, I think touch typing is going to boost your general productivity.

*Hot Tip*: The use of CTRL and META keys are almost universally applicable to navigating text blobs. For example, you can cycle through browser URL suggestions using C-n or C-p (n is for next, p is for previous line). Similarly, you can use C-f and C-b (f stands for forward, b stands for backward) to move forward and backwards by a character, M-f and M-b are used to move forward and backward by a word. Navigating text using these key bindings is very fast compared to arrow keys since you do not have to move your hand away from the home row.

Still not sure if you know touch typing or not? Open your editor (you are reading an Emacs blog, so I am hoping its Emacs), type the following phrase:

`buy gun bug hug fun run`

If you used anything other than your first fingers, you are not a touch typer.

Another easy way to find this out is to press CTRL key. If you used any other finger than your little finger (pinky), you are not a touch typer.

# Anecdote time

Shortly after I started trying out Emacs, I realized that it was really difficult for me to fluently do anything. The frequent use of CTRL and META keys really slowed me down. I resumed my college and Emacs took a back seat since the learning curve seemed too high. One spontaneous Friday, in my college dorm, I was involved in a fun typing speed contest with my friends (spirits were not involved). Turns out, I had terrible typing speed and my accuracy was abysmal. I quietly went into my room that day and recorded myself typing. My hand postures did not look natural. I also realized that my fingers had to move a lot, and that contributed to the high inaccuracy. After 8 years of hunt and peck typing, I had to Google, "what is the correct way to type".

# What is Touch Typing?

Touch typing is a method which trains us to type with just our sense of feel without using our eyes. This is possible because the amount of travel for each finger is minimal, so, less room for error. Furthermore, touch typing also enables you to maintain the same typing speed on any keyboard. Most of us have multiple setups (Office or School and Home), so this is really helpful.

# How?

This part is really simple. Just like everything else, practice makes perfect. Don't get me wrong, it's going to be excruciating at first knowing that ditching this new typing technique gets your job done quickly. Your productivity is going to be hit. The key is to keep pushing. If you don't want to switch to touch typing in your regular work (e.g. employment, class), I recommend setting aside at least half an hour everyday to practice for the first few weeks before finally making the switch over.

# References

I will list a few references that helped me practice.

- [KeyBR](https://www.keybr.com): This is an excellent resource to learn touch typing. This website shows the particular finger that you are supposed to use to press a key. It also uses adaptive learning to calibrate the frequency of letters so you are actually practicing the strokes that you need to.

- [TypingTest](https://www.typingtest.com): You should only try the typing test once you are a little confident in your typing. The exercises here are a little complicated and can be overwhelming without practice.
