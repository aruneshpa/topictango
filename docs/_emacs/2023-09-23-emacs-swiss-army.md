Hi, my name is Arunesh. I am a Software Engineer with a little over 5 years of work experience. If the word "tech enthusiast" was not so clich√©d, I would have identified as one. I saw a colleague of mine (who I hold in very high regard), use a fancy-looking editor to shuffle through significantly large log files, diff-ing sections to drill down to the problem. What also caught my attention was the excessive use of the pinky to basically do anything in the Editor. Now, I <em>have</em> been accused of giving an ol' fashioned college try to everything (believe me, I have gotten in trouble for that), and you can picture the rest.</p>

This is my story of how I fell in love with Emacs, and how only after a few years of using it, I am down to basically writing any text more than 2 lines in my editor. I also manage my tasks, plan my days, read my Emails, code, navigate repositories in Emacs (remember Swiss Army Knives?). For what it's worth, I also briefly considered maintaining this blog in Emacs. Oh well, someday!</p>

I will try to share a fresh perspective on the things I have learned. There are numerous blogs going into intricate details of how things work. So, I will only focus on sharing the minimum steps to <strong>just make something work</strong>. Don't worry, I will drop plenty of pointers for you to dig deeper and quench your thirst.</p>
