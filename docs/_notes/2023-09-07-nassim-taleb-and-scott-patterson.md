# Fat Tails

Fat tails occur whenever the greatest contribution comes from smallest number of events.  For example, Let's say you go to planet Mars, and you don't hear any news from Earth for a while.  On your way back, you get the news that a billion people have died. Which one is more likely cause - Ebola, or car accidents.  On the other end, if on a given day a random person dies, what is the more likely cause - Ebola, or car accident?

There are also environments where large deviations are not consequential.  If you have 1000 people on a weighing scale, and you add one more person to the scale, even if it is the heaviest person on the earth, how much of the total weight does the new person represent?  Not much.  If we make the sample size 10k, then it is diluted completely.  This is a tail event that is not consequential.  However, if you include one richest person on the scale, what percentage of total wealth will that one person represent?  Every body will be a rounding error compared to the other person.

# Precautionary Principle

You have a glass of water in front of you.  If I go on and say "the water in this glass is not poisonous at all."  Would it change your mind on whether you'd want to drink this water?  Another example would be, if you are about to board a plane from Mexico to JFK and the flight attendant goes "folks, we have uncertainty about the skills of the pilot.  We think he's good, but there's uncertainty."  Would you still take the flight?

# One Trick Ponies

Being a one trick pony is good.  That means you are good at that one thing that you do.
