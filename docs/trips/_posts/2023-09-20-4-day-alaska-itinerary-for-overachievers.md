# Best Time to Visit Alaska

Alaska is beautiful year-round.  Being that north on a world map guarantees one thing for Alaska -- lots of snow.  If you are one of the cool bunch who can put your skis on and rock winters, you do you.

But since mere mortals like us start to go in hibernation as soon as fall is over, May through September is the best season to visit Alaska.  Depending on what kind of a vacation you want, you can pick any month from these.  If you want to explore the vast, untouched wilderness, or, if you are on a budget, then shoulder months of May and September are for you.  If you don't mind large crowds, the peak months guarantee the best weather.

# What to Pack

Weather is pretty unpredictable in Alaska even during the summer months.  Usually we plan our vacations months in advance, so there are chances that you might get a completely different weather from the forecast at the time of your booking.  Fear not, layers are the name of the game here. It can get pretty windy when on a cruise, or soaking wet when hiking a glacier.  Don't forget to pack a pair of hiking boots as well.  Running shoes are not going to cut it in the chilly weather, on the glaciers, or the switchbacks of hikes.

Pro tip: pack a good pair of Binoculars - unless of course, if you are one of those people with a foot long 600mm zoom lens.  It will help you spot animals on faraway landscapes.  It also means you won't be at the mercy of your fellow travelers to lend you their pair (don't ask me how I know).  Animals like Dall sheep like to hang out really high up the mountain and without binoculars, you will not be able to tell snow from sheep on a mountain peak.

Check out the tips section for additional hacks on what (or what not) to pack.

# Day 1: Anchorage to Denali

We took a flight from Seattle, arriving in Anchorage at 10:30 PM.  We wanted an early morning start the next day, so we decided on reaching there the night before.  Of course, you can take an early morning flight to Anchorage as well.  Next morning, we started our journey towards Denali which is a 4 hours long, ultra picturesque drive.  Be sure to stop at vista points along the way to soak in all the views.

Our first two official stops were Denali View [South](https://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/aspunits/matsu/denaliviewso.htm) and [North](https://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/aspunits/matsu/denaliviewnocamp.htm) point.  These are considered one of the best views of the majestic, albeit mysterious, Denali peak.  The road from Anchorage to Danali also goes through [Broad pass](https://www.alaska.org/detail/broad-pass).  Blueberry fields and peaks on either side of the road follow you for miles.  If you are lucky, you may spot a Moose or a Caribou.  You will drive back on the same road on Day 3, so don't feel bad if you don't spot any wild life.  We were lucky that we got to experience it in two _very_ different weather conditions (did someone say unpredictable weather?).  It sounds counter intuitive, but the views are better when it is a little cloudy and drizzling.  Peaks shrouded by cloud always look more majestic to me.

Upon reaching Denali National park, take a free park shuttle to [Savage River area](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/savage-river-area.htm) and go on the [Savage River Loop trail](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/savagecanyon.htm).  This is a 1.7 mile loop with easy difficulty with hardly any elevation gain.  The trail goes nearly one mile before crossing the river with a beautiful wooden bridge.  Pro tip: start the hike counter clockwise and continue for a quarter mile off the maintained trail after crossing the bridge for even better views.  It was a recommendation from an awesome UW couple (Go Huskies!) that we met on the hike.

The park also does [Sled Dog Demonstrations](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/sled-dog-demonstrations.htm) 3 times a day.  Even though it was pouring during the demonstration, we had a lot of fun.  Plus, we got to pet a whole bunch of huskies.  We're not complaining.

In the evening, we drove to the [49th State Brewing](https://www.49thstatebrewing.com/denali/) in Healy for dinner and drinks.  If you are lucky (we were not!), you might get to try their "Smok" beer.  This is their world beer cup winning lager &#x2013; and they *love* to tell you that everywhere (posters in the bathroom anyone?).  We searched for that beer in a bunch of stores, and it felt as if the entire city had run out of it, but YMMV.

# Day 2: Denali National Park

Before starting your day, drop by the [Denali visitor center](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/the-denali-visitor-center.htm) and grab a souvenir.  You can also pick a coffee and a croissant from the Starbucks to kick start your day.  Full disclosure, when on vacation, I prefer local cafes (you should too).  They often carry local beans and helping local businesses is always a good thing.

Day two is dedicated to exploring Denali National Park.  In the morning, we did the much recommended [Horseshoe lake trail](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/horseshoe-lake-trail.htm).  It is a 2 mile moderate loop with minimal elevation gain.  The trail goes through a beautiful forest before looping around the Horseshoe lake.  There's also a section that goes along the Nenana river.  Being close to river gives you a high chance of spotting a bear, so be alert.  In fact, we spotted a few fresh bear paw prints on our way.  And no, we were not scared at all (we were!).

After the trail, we headed over to the [Alaska Railroad's Denali Depot](https://www.nps.gov/places/denali-depot-alaska-railroad.htm) for some cool shots of rail tracks.  If you are lucky, you will get to see a train passing buy.  We swung by the station to read up on Alaska Railroad trivia and let's just say that we have a new item on our bucket list for the next Alaska trip.

Final stretch of the day was taking the park transit shuttle from the bus depot.  Park road is closed to all vehicles and transit buses beyond mile 43.  There are several [bus tour options](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/visiting-denali.htm) to explore the park, but we went for the hop-on, hop-off [transit buses](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/shuttles.htm).  From the bus depot, the round trip is around 5 hours, so plan accordingly.  Note that there are no marked trails past mile 15 ([Savage River Area](https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/savage-river-area.htm)).  This helps maintain wilderness in the park (love it!!).  The hop-on, hop-off buses allow you to get down anywhere you like by simply asking the driver.  When you are ready to board the bus again, wave your hands to the next bus, and it will pick you up.  This tour is a must do in Denali national park.  In this 43 mile drive, we saw several caribou, a few moose, Dall sheep, several bears (including cubs).  Of course, the views throughout the ride were breathtaking.

After the trip, we had dinner at [Porpectus Pizzeria](https://www.prospectorspizza.com) in Denali Park.  It is a historic pizzeria with life size skins of grizzly bears, wolves, moose and several other animals.  We tried their Pesto Chicken Pizza and it was simply delicious.  We loved the experience so much that we kept coming here throughout our trip.

When we were done with dinner (at 10:30 ish), our server told us there was chance of seeing Northern lights around midnight.  We ended up driving north for close to an hour trying to spot Northern lights.  We saw *some lights*, we just weren't sure if they were northern lights.  Let's pretend they were.  We won't tell anybody if you won't.

We crashed into our hotel shortly after midnight.

# Day 3: Portage, Byron Glaciers

We started from our hotel early morning around 8:00 AM.  After a quick pit stop at [The Black Bear](https://www.theblackbeardenali.com) cafe in Denali Park for some coffee and a muffin, we started our drive to [Portage Glacier](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/chugach/home/?cid=stelprdb5251130).  It is a long drive (~5 hours), so feel free to take plenty of breaks along the way.  You're in Alaska, so even if you decide to stop at a random spot, chances are, the views will be beautiful.

We took a 5 minute pit stop at [Reflection Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/alaska/reflections-lake-trail) in Anchorage.  And after our failed attempt to grab lunch at [Moose's Tooth](https://moosestooth.net) Pub and Pizzeria (2 hour wait time), we headed over to the local lQdoba for a quick bite.  A burrito filled with what I am sure were the hottest jalapenos later, we resumed our drive to Portage.  At this point, I know you are tired of hearing this, but once again, *the drive was spectacular*.  Certain stretches of the drive have US101 vibes with mountains on one side, and ocean on the other.

We reached Portage around 4:00 PM.  Unfortunately, the visitor center was closed for the season, so we couldn't talk to any park rangers to get the lay of the land.  If you have a few hours, you have two options to explore Portage.  You can either take a [Portage glacier cruise](https://www.alaska.org/detail/portage-glacier-cruise), or, you can hike one of the trails.  We chose to hike the [Byron glacier trail](https://www.alaska.org/detail/byron-glacier-trail).  The trail follows along the glacier stream before ending at the glacier.  It got really apocalyptic (wind, mist, rain) at the end, but it was surreal to be able to touch a glacier.  We were soaked, but it was well worth it.

After the hike, we continued our way to Seward.  An hour and a half, and several pit stops to soak in amazing views later, we reached Breeze Inn, where we were staying for the night.

We decided to grab dinner at [Apollo restaurant](https://www.apollorestaurantak.com).  After cleaning up their yum salmon cakes, we decided to take a stroll on the harbor.  Seward has an peaceful small town vibe.  Boats ranging from tiny dinghies to yachts flood the harbor here.  We even saw a full blown cruise, with a basketball court on the top deck.  After a short bout with jealousy, we decided to call it a night and get some shuteye.

# Day 4: Kenai Fjord National Park, Seward

Last day of the trip is always a bummer.  You are already thinking about the vacation being over.  However, we decided to lean into the whole "yesterday is history, tomorrow is mystery, but today is a gift" philosophy.

Day four was dedicated to exploring the Kenai Fjord National Park.  Early morning, we decided to explore the [Exit Glacier area](https://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/exit-glacier-area.htm).  It is the only part of the park reachable by road.  I swear I will stop saying this at some point, but the drive to the glacier was amazing.  We stopped to take a picture of the national park entrance sign before stopping at a couple other view points.  We did the Exit Glacier Overlook trail, which is a easy to moderate 2 mile hike with great views of the glacier.l

After getting back to the harbor, we grabbed a coffee from the Natures Nectar (tiny coffee shop located in Breeze Inn)  and hopped on our boat for the [Kenai Fjord National Park tour](https://www.alaskacollection.com/day-tours/kenai-fjords-tours/kenai-fjords-national-park-tour/) offered by the folks at Kenai Fjord Tours.

Exquisite.  That's how I would describe my next 6 hours.  We saw several marine animals including Stellar sea lions, sea otters and harbor seals during our tour.  Our captain was gracious enough to sail along a pod of killer whales.  He even knew the name of the male.  We spotted several glaciers along the way (don't worry, your captain will point those to you) before finally stopping at the crown jewel, Aialik Glacier.  It is one of the largest glaciers in the bay.  We also got to see some calving.  On our way back, the captain took us through Spire Cove with amazing views of absurdly tall rock spires.  We also spotted a colony of Puffins.

Finally, we started our drive from Seward back to Anchorage to catch our late night flight to Seattle.  We tried our luck one more time in Anchorage and were able to get a table at the Moose's Tooth Pizzeria (yaay!) after a 45-ish minute wait.  The restaurant has an amazing vibe rich with it's history.  We spotted posters from well over 15 years ago.  After devouring their pizzas, chugging on their root beers and cream sodas, we headed back to the airport for our flight back.

# Tips

-   Ask for bear spray from the visitor center.  On the flip side, if you bought a bear spray, or borrowed one from someone, please donate it to the visitor center or nearby donation centers.
-   Where to eat in Denali National Park?
    -   Don't eat at the visitor center.  Take a 10 minute drive to the Denali Park city.  You can get everything from fast foods (Subway), to historic restaurants (Prospectus).
